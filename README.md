### ONNX Toolchain for DL

## Models used
MNIST, Squeezenet, and Alexnet

## PyTorch to ONNX
```In progress```

### Alexnet

A prebuilt Alexnet model was converted from Pytorch to ONNX and then inference was done using ONNX runtime

### Squeezenet

Another prebuilt model that is converted from Pytorch to ONNX using two different methods

1. Using built in Pytorch code to convert to ONNX

2. Using OLive tool  which can convert from various libraries to ONNX.

### MNIST
